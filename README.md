# NeuralStyleTransfer-Artwork
Implemented Neural Style transfer Algorithm to generate novel art using a pre-trained VGG-19 network

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, 
it merges two images, namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G).

The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.
